**Team 38** 

### Project Description

**Problem**<br>
In a time where our daily lifestyles are becoming increasingly sedentary, the role of diet in maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become a matter of upmost importance. This is clearly evident in the rising health awareness amongst young individuals. 
However, many often stuggle with curating and maintaining a healthy diet - let alone with meal planning - due to multiple reasons: 
- Lack of time from an exhausting 40+hr work week schedule 
- Dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, allergiesâ€¦) 
- Lack of knowledge about new and/or healthy recipes
<br>

**Solution**<br>
A web application that allows people to create personalized meal plans based on their dietary needs, schedule, available ingredients, and budget. Furthermore, it is equipped with a 'Nutrient Tracker' to allow users to track their nutrients - from calories to protein intake - based on their health interests and diet goals. 
<br>

**Key Features**<br>
1. **Customized Meals**: AI-generated recipes based on user's dietary requirements, goals, time duration preferences, and availability of ingredients. 
2. **Recipe Database**: The generated meals can be stored in a user-available recipe database which the user can use to save their favorite meals or to just store for future reference. This feature is also integrated with AI to recommend trending recipes (for instance, low-calorie, nutrient dense cucumber peanut butter salad from Instagram). 
3. **Grocery List**: Stores current available ingredients for meal customization. Curates a grocery list for your next grocery run based on your budget and the selected meals 
4. **Nutrient Tracker**: For individuals with health conscious goals, the app will utilize prompt engineering and user input (if given) to build a nutrition facts table with user-selected trackers (ex. calories, protein and sodium) for their meals. 
5. **Collaboration**: Feature to allow users to share their favorite recipes with their friends and families
<br>

**Why this project?**<br>
As mentioned before, with increasing number of health-conscious individuals and considering our increasingly sedentary lifestyle, we have become more aware of our eating choices in our attempt to adopt a healthy lifestyle. However, many people struggle to do so - a problem especially college students, who have just transitioned to a full-time job, face. The drastic change in lifestyle for them can be very difficult and overwhelming. The presence of this app can reduce some stress. 
Other reasons include: <br>
- Promotes healthy eating
- Involves the use of APIs, databases, front-end, back-end and user authentication, which is perfect for collaboration 
- Aligns with the goals of this web development course
Personal Reflection: I worked full-time for a semester and have been working part-time since then. A lot of my time went in meal prepping, which prevented me from working on my side projects or do coursework. For this reason, a web application catered to personalizing meal plan would really help in saving time and food-relation expenses (take outs) while granting individuals more time to focus on their hobbies or side projects they would like to purse or work on. <br>
